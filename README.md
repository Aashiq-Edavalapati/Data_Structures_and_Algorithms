### **Code Submission Guidelines**

#### General Guidelines

1. **Document Your Code**: Include a brief description at the top explaining its functionality.
2. **Complexity & Tests**: Clearly state the time and space complexity of your algorithm in comments and include test cases for your code, if applicable, and specify inputs and expected outputs.

#### Language-Specific Guidelines  

* **Python**: Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for style and indentation.  
* **Java**: Use meaningful class names and follow [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).  
* **C++**: Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., `camelCase` for variables).  
* **Go**: Adhere to [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) for idiomatic code, use `gofmt` for formatting, and prefer concise, readable code following Go conventions.  

---

### **Pull Request Process**

1. **Commit Your Changes**: Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git commit -m "Add: Dijkstra's algorithm in Python"
```

2. **Push Your Branch**:

```bash
git push origin feature/<branch-name>
```

3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Navigate to the original repository.
   - Click on **Pull Requests** > **New Pull Request**.
   - Select your branch and submit your PR.
   - Provide a detailed description of your changes, linking to relevant issues if applicable.
