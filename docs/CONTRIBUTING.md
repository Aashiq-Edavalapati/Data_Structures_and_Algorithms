## **Getting Started**

### **Clone the Repository**

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashrockzzz2003/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms.git
cd Data_Structures_and_Algorithms
```

---

## **How to Contribute**

### **Fork the Repository**

1. Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of this repository to create a personal copy under your GitHub account.
    
2. Clone your fork locally:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms.git
    ```
    
    Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.
    
3. Navigate to the repository's directory:
    
    ```bash
    cd Data_Structures_and_Algorithms
    ```

### **Set Upstream**

To keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ashrockzzz2003/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms.git
```

### **Create a Branch**

Before making any changes, create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<branch-name>
```

Examples of branch names:

- `feature/add-dijkstra`
- `fix/binary-search-bug`

---

## **Code Submission Guidelines**

### **General Guidelines**

1. **Document Your Code**: Include a brief description at the top explaining its functionality.
2. **Complexity & Tests**: Clearly state the time and space complexity of your algorithm in comments and include test cases for your code, if applicable, specifying inputs and expected outputs.

### **Language-Specific Guidelines**

- **Python**: Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for style and indentation.
- **Java**: Use meaningful class names and follow the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
- **C++**: Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables).
- **Go**: Adhere to [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) for idiomatic code, use `gofmt` for formatting, and prefer concise, readable code following Go conventions.

---

## **Pull Request Process**

1. **Commit Your Changes**: Ensure your commit message is clear and descriptive:
    
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add: Dijkstra's algorithm in Python"
    ```

2. **Push Your Branch**:
    
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/<branch-name>
    ```

3. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:

   - Navigate to the original repository.
   - Click on **Pull Requests** > **New Pull Request**.
   - Select your branch and submit your PR.
   - Provide a detailed description of your changes, linking to relevant issues if applicable.

4. **Respond to Feedback**: Collaborators may request changes or provide feedback. Be prompt in making updates.

## **Coding Standards**

1. **Readability**: Ensure your code is easy to read with proper comments and spacing.
2. **Consistency**: Follow the repository's existing coding style.
3. **Error Handling**: Include error-handling mechanisms where applicable.

---

## **Common Contribution Types**

The issues in the repository will mainly be categorized into the following types and can be assigned on a first-come-first-serve basis:

1. **New Algorithms**: Implement algorithms that are not yet part of the repository.
2. **Optimization**: Improve the performance of existing algorithms.
3. **Bug Fixes**: Address issues raised by other contributors.
4. **Documentation**: Enhance README files, add examples, or improve code comments.

---
